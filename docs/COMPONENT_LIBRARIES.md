# UI Component Libraries Reference

This document provides detailed information about the UI component libraries we'll be using in the Financial Insights project.

## Primary Libraries

### 1. Shadcn UI Dashboard Blocks

Shadcn UI provides a comprehensive set of UI components built on top of Tailwind CSS, with a focus on accessibility and customization. We'll use their dashboard blocks templates for our application.

#### Key Components We'll Use:

- Dashboard layout and navigation
- Cards for KPI and content blocks
- Form components for data input
- Dialog/modal components for confirmations and detailed views
- Button variants for different actions
- Tables for data display

#### Implementation Notes:

- Dashboard blocks are composable chunks, not prebuilt dashboards
- We'll use the pattern with sidebar navigation on desktop and mobile-friendly menu
- All components are themeable through Tailwind CSS configuration

## Additional Libraries

### 1. React Query / SWR

- Simplifies data fetching and synchronization
- Reduces boilerplate code for API calls

### 2. React Hook Form

For form handling and validation:

- Performant form validation
- Integrates well with Shadcn UI form components
- Supports schema validation with Zod or Yup

### 3. React Table

For advanced table functionality:

- Sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Customizable table layouts

### 4. React Icons

For comprehensive icon library:

- Large selection of icons from popular icon sets
- Consistent API for all icons
- Supports customization through props

## Design System Guidelines

We'll establish a consistent design system using these libraries:

### Colors

- Primary: Tailwind's blue-600 (#2563EB)
- Secondary: Tailwind's emerald-600 (#059669)
- Accent: Tailwind's amber-500 (#F59E0B)
- Error: Tailwind's red-600 (#DC2626)
- Background: Tailwind's gray-50 (#F9FAFB) / gray-900 (#111827)

### Typography

- Font family: Inter (sans-serif)
- Headings: font-semibold, Tailwind's text-2xl through text-5xl
- Body text: font-normal, Tailwind's text-base
- Labels and small text: font-medium, Tailwind's text-sm

### Spacing

- Follow Tailwind's spacing scale
- Consistent padding and margins using Tailwind's utility classes

### Component Variants

- Consistent use of variants for buttons, cards, and other components
- Define application-specific variants as needed using Tailwind

## Integration Strategy

Our approach to integrating these libraries:

1. **Base Layout**: Use Shadcn UI for the core application layout and navigation
2. **Data Visualization**: Use Tremor for all charts and data visualizations
3. **Form Components**: Use Shadcn UI form components with React Hook Form
4. **Data Tables**: Use React Table for advanced table features, styled with Tailwind
5. **Icons**: Use React Icons throughout the application

This integration will provide a consistent, accessible, and responsive user experience while leveraging the strengths of each library.
